# myotest-step-analysis-data-set-1
Pre-recorded 3 axes accelerometer signal data set, mix of walk and run, sensor worn on the belt

The sensor used was a KXTJ9 Accelerometer, placed on the belt. The sample acquisition frequency was 100Hz throughout the test. The test was also videoed for visual step recount.

Data set recorded both outdoor and indoor with a healthy male subject. The subject walked in straight lines, around corners, up two flights of stairs and pass two doors at self-selected paces. The floor surface included tarmac, tiles, carpet and rubber floor. The subject walked throughout the test (he did not run).

Visual recount by two independent judges resulted in a count of 212 and 213 walking steps (humans definitely aren’t perfect! Thankfully we have the machines).

14253 samples of timestamp and 3 axes accelerometer signal are recorded in this data set
